# Minesweeper App

## Introduction
This Minesweeper game on a square grid. The game is played in the console and is built using Java.

## Assumptions
- The game board is square and its size can range from 2x2 to 26x26.
- The user can specify the number of mines (up to 35% of the total number of cells).
- The game is played by selecting a cell to reveal by providing a row (A-Z) and a column (1-26) in the format `A1`, `B5`, etc.
- If a mine is revealed, the game is over.
- If all non-mine cells are revealed, the player wins the game.

- **Eclipse IDE** or another IDE that supports Java development
- **Maven** (to manage dependencies and build the project)
